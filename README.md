# MIP-Toolkit
This is my personal medical image processing toolkit. I'd like to write this library trying my best.
Here's the todo-list. If you have any trouble processing medical image or have a better way doing these work. Please let me know.

# TODO LIST(to be continued):
- convert NifTi to dicom
- convert NifTi to dicom series
- convert dicom to NifTi
- convert dicom series to NifTi
- convert NifTi to image series
- convert dicom to image series

I don't have too much time to maintain this lib in these few days because of my graduate design. If you want to help me complete this library. I'll thank you very much. Don't hesitate to pull request.
I'll start the library's work formally when I finish my G-D.
Wish myself good luck. :-)
